* To measure the code coverage of mbeddr languages, please perform the following steps:

1) copy emma.jar in the MPS_HOME/lib directory
2) build the mbeddr languages (goto mbeddr.home\code\languages" and run "buildLanguages.bat"
3) open a terminal in this directory (where this README file lies)
4) run "instrument.bat" - this will use emma to instrument the code
5) make sure that all MPS instances are closed
6) start an MPS instance; work with mbeddr (or generate the models containing the testcode)
7) close your MPS instance on which the coverage was gathered
8) run "report.bat"; the coverage information will be output in the "code_coverage" directory
