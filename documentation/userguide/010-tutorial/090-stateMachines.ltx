\section{State Machines}

Next to components and units, state machines are one of the main C extensions
available in mbeddr. They can be used directly in C programs, or alternatively,
embedded into components. To keep the overall complexity of the example
manageable, we will show state machine use directly in C.

\subsection{Implementing a State Machine}

To use state machines, the respective model has to use the
\ic{com.mbeddr.statemachines} devkit. We then create a new module
\ic{StateMachines} and add it to the build configuration. We can also create a
test case and call it from \ic{Main} (there is an intention on the \ic{test}
expression that automatically adds all test cases that are visible).

Our example state machine once again deals with judging a flight. Here are the
rules:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Once a flight lifts off, you get 100 points
  \item For each trackpoint where you go more than 100 mps, you get 10 points
  \item For each trackpoint where you go more than 200 mps, you get 20 points
  \item You should land as short as possible; for each trackpoint where you are
  on the ground, rolling, you get 1 point deducted.
  \item Once you land successfully, you get another 100 points.
\end{itemize}

This may not be the best example for a state machine, but it does show all of
the state machine's features while staying with our example so far :-)
So let's get started with a state machine.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
statemachine analyzeFlight initial = <no initial> { 
}
\end{lstlisting}

We know that the airplane will be in various states: on the ground, flying,
landing (and still rolling), landed, and crashed. So let's add the states. Once
you add the first of these states, the \ic{initial} state will be set; of course it can
be changed later:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
statemachine analyzeFlight initial = beforeFlight { 
  state beforeFlight { 
  } 
  state airborne { 
  } 
  state landing { 
  } 
  state landed { 
  } 
  state crashed { 
  } 
}
\end{lstlisting}

Our state machine is also a little bit untypical in that it only takes one
event \ic{next}, which represents the next trackpoint submitted for evaluation.
Note how an event can have arguments of arbitrary C types, \ic{Trackpoint} in
the example. There is one more event that resets the analyzer:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
statemachine analyzeFlight initial = beforeFlight { 
  in next(Trackpoint* tp) 
  in reset() 
  state beforeFlight ... 
}
\end{lstlisting}

We also need a variable \ic{points} that keeps track of the points as they
accumulate over the flight analysis:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
statemachine analyzeFlight initial = beforeFlight { 
  in next(Trackpoint* tp)
  in reset() 
  var int16 points = 0 
  state beforeFlight ... 
}
\end{lstlisting}

We can now implement the rules outlined above using transitions and actions. Let
us start with some simple ones. Whenever we enter \ic{beforeFlight} we reset the
points to 0. We can achieve this with an entry action in \ic{beforeFlight}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
state beforeFlight { 
  entry { points = 0; } 
}
\end{lstlisting}

We also understand that all states other than \ic{beforeFlight}, the \ic{reset}
event must transition back to the \ic{beforeFlight}. Note that as a consequence
of the entry action in the \ic{beforeFlight} state, the points get resetted in
all three cases:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
state airborne { 
  on reset [ ] -> beforeFlight 
} 
state landing { 
  on reset [ ] -> beforeFlight 
} 
state landed { 
  on reset [ ] -> beforeFlight 
}
\end{lstlisting}

We can now implement the rules. As soon as we submit a trackpoint where the
altitude is greater than zero we can transition to the airborne state. This
means we have successfully taken off, and we should get 100 points in bonus.
\ic{TAKEOFF} is a global constant representing 100 (\ic{\#define TAKEOFF =
100;}):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
state beforeFlight { 
  entry { points = 0; }  
  on next [tp->alt > 0 m] -> airborne 
  exit { points += TAKEOFF; }  
} 
\end{lstlisting}

Let us look at what can happen while we are in the air. First of all, if when we
are airborne we receive a trackpoint with zero altitude and zero speed
(without going through an orderly landing process), we have crashed. If we are
at altitute zero with a speed greater than zero, we are in the process of
landing. The other two cases deal with flying at over 200 and over 100 mps. In
this case we stay in the \ic{airborne} state (by transitioning to itself) but we
increase the points:


\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
state airborne { 
  on next [tp->alt == 0 m && tp->speed == 0 mps] -> crashed 
  on next [tp->alt == 0 m && tp->speed > 0 mps] -> landing 
  on next [tp->speed > 200 mps] -> airborne { points += VERY_HIGH_SPEED; } 
  on next [tp->speed > 100 mps] -> airborne { points += HIGH_SPEED; }
  on reset [ ] -> beforeFlight 
}
\end{lstlisting}

Note that the transitions are checked in the order of their appearance in the
state machine; if several of them are ready to fire, the first one is picked. So
be careful to put the "tighter cases" first. The landing process is essentially
similar:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
state landing { 
  on next [tp->speed == 0 mps] -> landed 
  on next [ ] -> landing { points--; } 
  on reset [ ] -> beforeFlight 
} 
state landed { 
  entry { points += LANDING; } 
  on reset [ ] -> beforeFlight 
} 
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Interacting with Other Code --- Outbound}

So how do we deal with the \ic{crashed} state? Assume this flight analyzer is
running on some kind of server, analyzing flights that are submitted via the web
(a bit like \ic{http://onlinecontest.org}). If we detect a crash, we want to
notify a bunch of people of the event, so they can call the the BFU or whatever.
In any case, assume we want to call external code. You can do this in two ways.
The first one is probably obvious. We simply create a function which we call
from an entry or exit action:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
statemachine FlightAnalyzer initial = beforeFlight {
  ... 
  state crashed { 
    entry { raiseAlarm(); }
  } 
}
...
void raiseAlarm() { 
  // send emails or whatever
}
\end{lstlisting}

Another alternative, which is more suitable for formal analysis (as we will see
later) involves out events. From the entry action we \ic{send} an out event,
which we define earlier. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
statemachine FlightAnalyzer initial = beforeFlight {
  out crashNotification()
  ...
  state crashed { 
    entry { send crashNotification(); }  
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Sending an event this way has no effect (yet), but we express from within the
state machine that something that corresponds semantically to a crash
notification will happen at this point (as we will see, this allows us to write
model checkers that verify that a crash notification will go out). What remains
to be done is to bind this event to application code. We can do this by adding a
binding to the out event declaration:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
out crashNotification() => raiseAlarm
\end{lstlisting}

The effect is the best of both worlds: in the generated code we do call the
\ic{raiseAlarm} function, but on the state machine level we have abstracted the
implementation from the intent. 


\subsection{Interacting with Other Code --- Inbound}

Let us write some test code that interacts with a state machine. To do a
meaningful test, we will have to create a whole lot of trackpoints. So to do
this we create helper functions. These in turn need \ic{malloc} and \ic{free},
so we first create an additional external module that represents \ic{stdlib.h}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
// external module contents are exported by default 
external module stdlib_stub imports nothing resources header: <stdlib.h>{ 
  void* malloc(size_t size); 
  void free(void* ptr);
}
\end{lstlisting}

We can now create a helper function that creates a new trackpoint based on an
altitude and speed passed in as arguments:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
Trackpoint* makeTP(uint16 alt, int16 speed) { 
  static int8 trackpointCounter = 0; 
  trackpointCounter++; 
  Trackpoint* tp = ((Trackpoint*) malloc(sizeof Trackpoint)); 
  tp->id = trackpointCounter; 
  tp->timestamp = introduceunit[trackpointCounter -> s]; 
  tp->alt = introduceunit[alt -> m]; 
  tp->speed = introduceunit[speed -> mps]; 
  return tp; 
}
\end{lstlisting}

We can now start writing (and running!) the test. We first create an instance of
the state machine (state machines act as types and can be instantiated). We then
initialize the state machine by using the \ic{sminit} statement:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
exported test case testSM1 { 
  FlightAnalyzer f; 
  sminit(f); 
}
\end{lstlisting}

Initially we should be in the \ic{beforeFlight} state. We can chech this with an
assertion:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
assert(0) smIsInState(f, beforeFlight);
\end{lstlisting}

We also want to make sure that the \ic{points} are zero initially. To be able to
write a constraint that checks this we first have to make the \ic{points}
variable \ic{readable} from the outside. An intention on the variable achieves
this. We can then write:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
assert(1) f.points == 0;
\end{lstlisting}

Let us now create the first trackpoint and pass it in. This one has speed, but
no altitude, so we are in the take-off run. We assume that we remain in the
\ic{beforeFlight} state and that we still have 0 points:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
smtrigger(f, next(makeTP(0, 20))); 
assert(2) smIsInState(f, beforeFlight) && f.points == 0;
\end{lstlisting}

Now we lift off by setting the alt to 100 meters:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
smtrigger(f, next(makeTP(100, 100))); 
assert(3) smIsInState(f, airborne) && f.points == 100;
\end{lstlisting}

So as you can see it is easy to interact from regular C code with a state
machine. For testing, we have special support that checks if the state machine
transitions to the desired state if a specific event is triggered. Here is some
example code (note that you can use the \ic{test statemachine} construct only
within test cases):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
test statemachine f { 
  next(makeTP(200, 100)) -> airborne 
  next(makeTP(300, 150)) -> airborne 
  next(makeTP(0, 90)) -> landing 
  next(makeTP(0, 0)) -> landed 
}
\end{lstlisting}


This concludes our discussion of state machines. If you are a C buff, you may
have noticed that our application contains a memory leak. We allocate all kinds
of heap data (in the \ic{makeTP} function), but we never free it again. Read the
chapter \todo{ref} to do something about that.

\subsection{Verifying State Machines}

Just like decision tables, state machines can also be verified. While in
decision tables the verification is based on SMT solving, the state machine
verification uses model checking. However, the fundamental approach is similar: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Mark a state machine as \ic{verifiable} using an intention
  \item Verifiable state machines are restricted in some ways, so after marking
  the state machine as \ic{verifiable}, you may have to refactor it in a way so
  it is inside the verifiable subset. For example, it is not possible to assign
  to the same variable more than once during one transition (taking into
  account all exit and entry actions).
  \item You can then use the context menu and select \ic{Verify State Machine} to
  run the verification
  \item After running the verification, the result is shown in a separate view. 
\end{itemize}

Model checking requires that users specify a set of properties which the state
machine must implement. The model checker checks for each property whether it
holds \emph{in all cases}. If it doesn't, the result of the model checker shows
a counter example, i.e. one possible execution of the state machine that leads
to a situation where the property does not hold. In mbeddr, every state machine
is checked for a specific set of properties \emph{automatically}, so you as the
user don't have to specify them. These automatic checks include the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Is every state reachable, i.e. is there \emph{some} sequence of events
  in the state machine that leads into each state. If not, the state is dead and
  can be removed.
  \item Is every transition potentially executable, i.e. is there \emph{some}
  sequence of events that fires each transition. If not, the transition could be
  removed.
  \item Are all transitions deterministic, i.e. is it always clear which
  transition must fire. If not, more than one transition could fire at a given
  time, and the decision which one to fire is unclear\footnote{In the mbeddr
  implementation (based on a \ic{switch} statement) the first of these
  transitions will fire. However, one should not rely on this fact and the
  verifier marks it as a problem.}.
  \item The state machines language supports bounded integers (i.e. integers
  that specify a value range). For each variable that uses a bounded integer
  type, the verifier checks that the variable actually stays within the
  specified bounds.
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center} 
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{figures/tutorial/smverres.png}
\end{center}
\caption{The view that shows the results of the verfication of the
\ic{FlightAnalyzer} state machine.}
\label{smverres}
\end{figure}




\parhead{Verifying the FlightAnalyzer Machine} We attach the \ic{verifiable}
flag to the \ic{FlightAnalyzer} state machine and run the verifier.
\fig{smverres} shows the result. It has two problems. Firt, It claims that the
\ic{landing} state has nondeterministic transitions. The counter example is this:

\begin{lstlisting}
State beforeFlight
in_event: next   next(0, -32768)
State beforeFlight
in_event: next   next(1, -32768)
State airborne
in_event: next   next(0, 101)
State landing
in_event: next   next(0, 0)
State landed
in_event: next   next(0, -32768)
\end{lstlisting}

\greyboxnote{Contrary to intuition, the actually problematic step may not be the
last one! In the example here, the \ic{next(0, 0)} is the offending situation!}

In this example, in the \ic{landing} state, the \ic{next(0, 0)} event is fired
and results in non-determinism. Let us look at the code: 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
state landing { 
  on next [tp->speed == 0 mps] -> landed 
  on next [ ] -> landing { points--; }  
  on reset [ ] -> beforeFlight 
} 
\end{lstlisting}

The first transition fires if \ic{speed == 0}, which is the case for
\ic{next(0, 0)}. The second one fires in any case. Of course what we wanted to
express there is that this one should only fire \emph{otherwise}. It the
generated C code it happens to work correctly because of the ordering of the
transitions. But in general, the situation is ambiguous: \ic{next(0, 0)}
potentially fires both. We can fix the problem by adding another guard
condition (rerun the model checker to test this!):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
state landing { 
  on next [tp->speed == 0 mps] -> landed 
  on next [tp->speed != 0 mps ] -> landing { points--; }  
  on reset [ ] -> beforeFlight 
} 
\end{lstlisting}



The second problem is in the \ic{airborne} state. Once again, the actual problem
is in the second-to-last step: \ic{next(0, 101)}. Here is the respective state:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
state airborne { 
  on next [tp->alt == 0 && tp->speed == 0] -> crashed 
  on next [tp->alt == 0 && tp->speed > 0] -> landing 
  on next [tp->speed > 200] -> airborne { points += VERY_HIGH_SPEED; }  
  on next [tp->speed > 100] -> airborne { points += HIGH_SPEED; }  
  on reset [ ] -> beforeFlight 
}
\end{lstlisting}

The first problem we observe is that transition 4 is also true whenever
transition 3 is true as well. So we should change transition four to

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
on next [tp->speed > 100 && tp->speed <= 200] -> 
   airborne { points += HIGH_SPEED; }
\end{lstlisting}

However, rerunning the verification still FAILs this state. The real problem is
an ambiguity between transition 2 and transition four, because we do not check
for the altitude in transitions 3 and 4. Once again, we imply an ordering of the
guard conditions ... the C implementation works fine.  Here is the correct
formulation of the state's transitions:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr]
state airborne { 
  on next [tp->alt == 0 && tp->speed == 0] -> crashed 
  on next [tp->alt == 0 && tp->speed > 0] -> landing 
  on next [tp->alt > 0 && tp->speed > 200] -> 
        airborne { points += VERY_HIGH_SPEED; } 
  on next [tp->alt > 0 && speed > 100 && speed <= 200] -> 
  	    airborne { points += HIGH_SPEED; } 
  on reset [ ] -> beforeFlight 
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Hierarchical State Machines}

State machines can also be hierarchical. This means that a state may contain
essentially a sub-state machine. The following piece of code shows an example.
Here are the semantics:

\begin{itemize}
  \item When a transition from outside a composite state targets
a composite state, the initial state in that composite state is activated.
  \item A composite state can have transitions. These act as if they were
  defined for each of the states of the composite state.
  \item If a transition from an inner state A crosses a composite
  state-boundary (B), then the actions happen in the following order: exit
  actions of A, exit actions of B, transition action, and entry action of the
  transition's target.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=mbeddr, morekeywords={composite}]
statemachine HierarchicalFlightAnalyzer initial = beforeFlight { 
  in next(Trackpoint* tp) 
  in reset() 
  out crashNotification() => raiseAlarm 
  readable var int16 points = 0 
  state beforeFlight { 
    on next [tp->alt > 0 m] -> airborne 
    exit { points += TAKEOFF; } 
  }  
  composite state airborne initial = flying { 
    on reset [ ] -> beforeFlight { points = 0; } 
    on next [tp->alt == 0 m && tp->speed == 0 mps] -> crashed 
    state flying (airborne.flying) { 
      on next [tp->alt == 0 m && tp->speed > 0 mps] -> landing 
      on next [tp->speed > 200 mps] -> flying { points += VERY_HIGH_SPEED; } 
      on next [tp->speed > 100 mps] -> flying { points += HIGH_SPEED; } 
    } 
    state landing (airborne.landing) { 
      on next [tp->speed == 0 mps] -> landed 
      on next [ ] -> landing { points--; } 
    } 
    state landed (airborne.landed) { 
      entry { points += LANDING; } 
    } 
  }  
  state crashed { 
    entry { send crashNotification(); } 
  }  
}
\end{lstlisting}



\subsection{State Machine Diagrams}

State Machines can also be rendered as a diagram; \fig{vsm} shows an example.
