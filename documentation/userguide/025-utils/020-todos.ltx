\section{TODOs} 
\label{todoutil}

mbeddr comes with a special view for collecting and showing TODOs in comments.
Anywhere within the comments discussed above, you can write \ic{TODO and then
some text} or \ic{TODO(category) and then some text} (see next screenshot):

To find the TODOs anywhere in your project, use the $Tools -> mbeddr TODO$. It
shows the TODOs in the form of a Find Usages dialog.

The view has many view options (try them!). The most important one is the top
left one. Pressing it enables categories. In this case the TODOs are grouped by
what has been specified by \ic{category} in the \ic{TODO(category)} format.
