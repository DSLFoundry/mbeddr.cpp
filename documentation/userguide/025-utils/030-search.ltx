\section{Text-Searching Models}
\label{searching}

MPS provides all kinds of finders and search support for concepts and nodes, but
not for plain text. It is only possible to text-search within one root (such as
a C module or a requirements module). It is not possible to search a whole
model. The default root-wide search also just searches the projection, so
anything that is not (currently) projected is not found.

mbeddr comes with a dedicated, model-wide\footnote{It will likely be extended
to search whole solutions} text search. By default, it searches for a substring
in all names of program elements. In addition, program elements can implement a
special interface (\ic{ISearchSupport}) to support searching in other text
properties. For example, documents (\sect{doclang}) or requirements
(\sect{details_reqs}) can be full-text searched this way.

\parhead{Performing a Search} To open a search window for a model, select
\ic{Model Search} from its context menu or press \keystroke{Ctrl-Alt-S} on a
model. A tool window opens on the right:

\end{center}

Entering a substring and pressing \keystroke{Enter} (or pressing the \ic{go}
button) will search through the respective model and report all nodes that
contain the substring. The result table contains the name, its concept (i.e.
what kind of thing it is) and its namespace.

You can double click on a table entry to open the respective node in the editor.
