Mbeddr core
===========

To install: please, visit http://mbeddr.com for instructions!

mbeddr aims at creating a different way of developing embedded software systems. Instead of using archaic modeling tools and manually written C code, we use the open source [JetBrains MPS](http://jetbrains.com/mps) language workbench to create an integrated approach to embedded development, where C programming, DSLs, domain specific extensions to C, product line variability, requirements traceability and model checking are supported directly.

At this point we are well ahead in developing an implementation of C in MPS which can then be used as a basis for domain-specific extensions. The development progress can be see from our [blog page](http://mbeddr.com/blog/).
