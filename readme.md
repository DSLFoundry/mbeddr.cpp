# mbeddr.cpp

C++ extension to [mbeddr](http://mbeddr.com).

Implementation of a subset of C++ 14.
It supports classes, methods, exceptions, namespaces, and partially operator overloading and templates.

We're happy for other uses and contributions!

Have a look at the [documentation directory](https://github.com/DSLFoundry/mbeddr.cpp/tree/master/documentation/cpp) for the original project documentation.
